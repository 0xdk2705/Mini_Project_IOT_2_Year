**Introduction**

Exhaust fans play a crucial role in maintaining indoor air quality by removing moisture, odors, and pollutants. Traditionally, they are controlled manually, requiring users to physically interact with the device. However, with the integration of IoT technology, it is now possible to control exhaust fans remotely using smartphones or other connected devices.

**Objectives**

To develop an IoT-based system that enables users to remotely control a mini exhaust fan using an Android smartphone. The system should be energy-efficient, easy to use, and capable of integrating with other smart home devices. By leveraging the capabilities of IoT and smartphone technology, this system offers a convenient, efficient, and energy-saving solution for managing indoor air quality.

**Implementation**

The implementation of the automated exhaust fan system involves two main components:

**Hardware Development:** This includes the use of an ESP32 microcontroller to control the exhaust fan's speed and integrate IoT capabilities for data monitoring via the Blynk application.
**Software Implementation:** The system is programmed to adjust the fan speed based on temperature readings and send notifications to users, ensuring efficient operation and energy savings.
